# Computer Says No

It's never easy to write a good message.

It's **even harder** to write an error message.

As engineers, this is a challenge. Unless your project / company
has a dedicated UX guy, or perhaps a copywriter you can bug (:beetle: no pun intended), it is hard for engineers to write error messages that are **succinct**, **informative** and **readable**.

This project aims to be a curation on some resources around this topic, as well as a quick cheatsheet for fellow engineers :bow:

## Quick Cheatsheet

### Do
:thumbsup:

- Do keep it short and factual. *How can users quickly understand the situation?*
- Do offer a suggestion / next action. *How can users move forward from this?*
- Do try to provide a link (support page, search on StackOverflow, etc.) if possible *Where can users see more detailed information?*
- Do provide enough context to the specific exception (helps user debug). *How can users search on manuals / online with these information?*
- Do empathize with users. *How would you react if you see this message?*

### Don't
:thumbsdown:

- Avoid vague explanations that you don't understand either. *We've all been there before.*
- Don't use the wrong tone, and scare / offend the user. *It's likely an error from our part, not the user.*
- Avoid reference to implementation details. *Less noise.*
- Avoid abbreviations. *Unless using global terms, users likely do not understand*
