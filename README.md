# Computer Says No

It's never easy to write a good message.
It's even harder to write an error message.

As engineers, this is a challenge. Unless your project / company
has a dedicated UX guy, or perhaps a copywriter you can bug (:beetle: no pun intended), it is hard for engineers to write error messages that are succinct, informative and readable.

This project aims to be a curation on some resources around this topic, as well as a quick cheatsheet for fellow engineers :bow:
